# Sentiment-Analysis
I fine-tuned a BERT model for sentiment analysis on student reviews using Hugging Face. A synthesized dataset was preprocessed, and fine-tuning used a classification head, train-validation split, and AdamW optimizer. Performance was evaluated with accuracy, F1-score, and a confusion matrix, with results and code in a GitHub repository.
